## Introduction
This project is part of our group project for **CSCI323 - Modern Artificial Intelligence** module at the SIM-UOW. The project focuses on applying artificial intelligence, specifically machine learning, to predict the resale prices of HDB flats in Singapore. Using a dataset of over 200,000 resale transactions recorded between January 2017 and May 2025, we explore how various factors—such as flat type, location, floor area, and lease details—affect pricing patterns.

Our main objective is to build predictive models that can estimate resale prices accurately and analyse the most influential factors driving those prices. Since property values are shaped by a combination of structural, geographical, and temporal elements, this project sits at the intersection of real estate analytics, urban development, and AI-driven forecasting. We believe this work has wide-reaching applications. In the property market, it can help buyers and sellers assess fair prices and spot potential deals. Real estate platforms might integrate these models into their pricing tools or dashboards to enhance user experience. Policymakers can also use the insights to better understand housing trends and develop data-informed strategies to maintain affordability. Lastly, the project offers a valuable case study in applying machine learning to real-world structured data, making it a practical learning resource for students and educators in AI.
