## Introduction
This project is part of our group project for **CSCI323 - Modern Artificial Intelligence**
module at the SIM-UOW. The project focuses on applying artificial intelligence,
specifically machine learning, to predict the resale prices of HDB flats in Singapore.
Using a dataset of over 200,000 resale transactions recorded between January 2017
and May 2025, we explore how various factors—such as flat type, location, floor area,
and lease details—affect pricing patterns.

## Objective
This project aims to develop predictive models for resale property prices, considering real-world structured data, geographical, and temporal factors. The insights from these models have broad applications: assisting buyers and sellers in assessing fair prices, enabling real estate platforms to enhance pricing tools, informing policymakers on housing trends and affordability strategies.
